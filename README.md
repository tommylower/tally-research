# tally-frontpage

Markdown content for AI crawler indexing on tally.xyz.

## What this is

This repo hosts an `llms.md` file that provides structured content for AI agents and crawlers (ClaudeBot, GPTBot, etc.) to read. This is part of optimizing for the "third audience" — AI systems that consume web content alongside humans and search engines.

## How it works

1. The `llms.md` file contains Tally's core product information in clean Markdown
2. A `<link rel="alternate">` tag on tally.xyz points crawlers to this file
3. AI agents can read structured content instead of parsing HTML
