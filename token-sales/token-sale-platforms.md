# Tally vs CoinList: Which Token Sale Platform Is Right for You?

CoinList and Tally both help projects launch tokens, but they represent fundamentally different approaches. CoinList is a platform you use. Tally is infrastructure you own.

This guide breaks down the differences so you can decide which is right for your project.

---

## The Core Difference

**CoinList:** You launch on their platform, to their users, under their rules. They handle compliance, distribution, and the sale experience. You get access to their investor base but don't own the relationship.

**Tally:** You launch on your domain, to your users, with your brand. Tally provides the infrastructure — sale mechanics, compliance, smart contracts — but you own the experience and the audience.

## Compliance

### CoinList

CoinList provides institutional-grade compliance as a managed service:
- They handle KYC/KYB for all participants
- They determine geographic restrictions
- They manage regulatory relationships
- You rely on their legal framework

**Pros:** Hands-off compliance, established legal structure
**Cons:** Limited control, their restrictions apply to your sale

### Tally

Tally provides compliance infrastructure that you configure:
- [KYC/KYB/KYI](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/compliance) built into sale flow
- You configure geo-blocking by jurisdiction
- Region-specific lockups and vesting rules
- OFAC and sanctions screening
- Designed for CLARITY Act compliance

**Pros:** Full control, US compliance-ready, configurable rules
**Cons:** You need legal counsel to define your compliance strategy

## Sale Experience

### CoinList

Participants go to CoinList.co:
- Must create CoinList account
- Navigate CoinList's interface
- Subject to CoinList's UX decisions
- You're one of many projects on the platform

**Feedback from Monad's CoinList sale:** Crypto-native investors compared it unfavorably to direct on-chain sales. Participants faced friction with account requirements and platform navigation.

### Tally

Participants stay on your domain:
- Branded, white-labeled experience
- Your UX, your design
- Direct relationship with participants
- You own the data

**Example:** Hyperwave's LBP sale featured a custom-branded interface matching their visual identity. Users never left the Hyperwave experience.

## Sale Mechanisms

### CoinList

- Fixed-price sales
- Auction formats
- Allocation determined by CoinList

### Tally

- **[LBPs](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools):** Price discovery through declining curves, discourages speculation
- **[CCAs](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/continuous-clearing-auction):** Manipulation-resistant uniform-price auctions with automatic Uniswap v4 liquidity
- **[Fixed-price](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/fixed-price):** Simple predetermined pricing with configurable allocation rules

You choose the mechanism that fits your distribution goals.

---

## Post-Sale Infrastructure

### CoinList

Token sale only. After the sale, you need separate providers for:
- DEX liquidity
- Governance
- Staking
- Future token distributions

### Tally

Full lifecycle on one platform:
- **[Post-sale liquidity](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/post-sale-liquidity):** Automatically seed Uniswap or Balancer pools
- **[Vesting and lockups](https://docs.tally.xyz/token-sales/lockups):** On-chain, configurable, transparent
- **[Governance](https://tally.xyz/governance):** Proposals, voting, delegation
- **[Staking](https://tally.xyz/staking):** Incentive programs and value accrual
- **[Airdrops](https://tally.xyz/airdrops):** Targeted distribution with eligibility rules

No need to stitch together multiple vendors or migrate between platforms.

## When to Choose CoinList

CoinList makes sense if:

- You want to fully outsource compliance and don't need control
- You're targeting CoinList's existing investor base
- You don't need post-sale infrastructure (governance, staking, etc.)
- You're okay with participants going through CoinList's platform
- You want the CoinList brand association

---

## When to Choose Tally

Tally makes sense if:

- You want to own the sale experience and audience data
- You need compliance infrastructure but want to configure it yourself
- You want governance, staking, and airdrops on the same platform
- You're building for US regulatory compliance (CLARITY Act)
- You want white-labeled branding on your own domain
- You want to choose your sale mechanism (LBP, CCA, or fixed-price)

---

## The Bottom Line

CoinList is a managed service — you get their compliance, their users, their platform. It's hands-off but you don't own the relationship.

Tally is infrastructure — you get the tools to run a compliant token sale on your terms, with your brand, keeping your audience. It requires more decisions but gives you full control.

For projects that view their token sale as a strategic moment to build direct relationships with their community, Tally provides the infrastructure to do that without compromising on compliance.
