# How to Launch a Token: A Complete Guide

Launching a token is one of the most consequential decisions a project can make. Done right, a token sale raises capital, builds community, and aligns incentives in a single event. Done poorly, it creates regulatory risk, mercenary capital, and long-term headaches.

This guide walks through the key steps — from legal planning to post-launch operations — based on what's worked for projects raising millions in compliant token sales.

## 1. Decide If a Token Makes Sense

Not every project needs a token. Consider launching one only if:

- **Your platform benefits from token-based coordination.** Governance tokens that control protocol parameters, staking tokens that secure networks, or access tokens that gate features all have clear utility. Tokens without function tend to underperform.

- **You can integrate real blockchain utility.** Successful tokens have use cases from day one — governance, staking, or access rights. If a token would be purely speculative with no functional purpose, it's probably not the right path.

- **You're prepared for the operational burden.** Managing a distributed holder base, ongoing compliance obligations, and public treasury scrutiny requires dedicated resources.

If you're unsure, the answer is probably no. Tokens create obligations that last years.

## 2. Legal and Compliance Planning

This is the foundation. Skip it and everything else becomes harder.

**Define the token's utility and economic parameters.** What does the token do? How does supply change over time? What rights do holders have?

**Engage legal counsel experienced in securities law and token offerings.** Different jurisdictions have different rules. The US, EU (MiCA), and offshore structures each have tradeoffs.

**Determine which jurisdictions you'll include or exclude.** Most projects block certain regions (US, in some cases) or require specific compliance steps for participation.

**Plan KYC/KYB processes.** Identity verification is now standard for compliant token sales. Decide what level of verification you need and which provider will handle it.

**Consider KYI (Know Your Issuer).** Linking your token contract to verified team identities addresses "unknown deployer risk" that concerns institutional investors.

This phase typically takes months, not weeks. Start early.

## 3. Choose Your Sale Mechanism

The mechanism you choose shapes who participates, how price is discovered, and what happens post-sale.

### Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs)

Price starts high and declines over time, discouraging early speculation. The market finds fair value rather than bots front-running a fixed price.

**Best for:** Projects that want broad distribution and market-driven price discovery.

**How it works:** Pool weights shift from heavily favoring your token (e.g., 99/1) to balanced (e.g., 65/35). As weights shift, price drops unless buyers step in.

### Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCAs)

Fully on-chain auction where bidders place orders that are split across auction blocks. Each block clears at the identified market price.

**Best for:** Projects that want transparent, manipulation-resistant price discovery with built-in liquidity seeding.

**How it works:** Bidders specify a budget and maximum price. The protocol spreads bids across the auction period. Uniform clearing means all successful bidders pay the same price.

### Fixed-Price Sales

Set a predetermined price with optional allocation limits per wallet.

**Best for:** Projects with high conviction on valuation or specific distribution goals.

**Tradeoffs:** Overpriced sales don't sell out (public failure). Underpriced sales require allocation rules that may feel unfair.

## 4. Set Sale Parameters

Once you've chosen a mechanism, configure the details:

- **Timeline:** When does KYC open? When does bidding start? How long does the sale run?
- **Amount to sell:** What percentage of supply goes to the public sale?
- **Bid currency:** USDC, USDT, or ETH are most common.
- **Floor price:** The minimum acceptable clearing price.
- **Graduation threshold:** Minimum raise amount — if not met, the sale cancels and bids refund.
- **Allocation limits:** Per-wallet caps to ensure broad distribution.
- **Geo-blocking:** Which jurisdictions are excluded?
- **Lockups:** Region-specific vesting or lockup requirements.

## 5. Distribution and Custody

**Audit your smart contracts.** This is non-negotiable.

**Plan for both retail and institutional participants.** Retail users self-custody via wallets. Institutional buyers often require custodial delivery through BitGo, Fireblocks, Anchorage, or similar.

**Map all allocations clearly:**
- Public sale percentage
- Team tokens (with vesting)
- Prior investor allocations (with vesting)
- Community airdrops
- Treasury reserves

**Test the distribution process before launch.** Simulate different scenarios: what if you hit the cap early? What if you reach only 50%?

---

## 6. Vesting and Lockups

Team and early investor tokens should vest over 1-4 years. This is both good practice and increasingly expected by regulators and sophisticated buyers.

**On-chain vesting contracts provide transparency.** Anyone can verify that tokens are locked.

**Consider lockup options for public buyers.** MegaETH offered bonus allocation for participants accepting a 1-year lock, which also provided a compliance pathway for US accredited investors.

---

## 7. Execution

**Open KYC verification weeks in advance.** MegaETH had 100,000+ verified participants before the sale started. That doesn't happen overnight.

**Prepare support channels.** Discord, Telegram, dedicated help desk. Despite preparation, users will have KYC issues and questions. Responsiveness builds trust.

**Monitor the sale in real time.** Funds raised, participant count, time remaining. Provide updates. If you've built in flexibility (like raising a cap), use it judiciously and communicate changes clearly.

**After closing, distribute tokens promptly.** Share contract addresses and block explorer links so holders can verify balances.

---

## 8. Post-Launch Operations

The sale is just the beginning.

### Seed Liquidity

If you enable DEX integration, a portion of funds and unsold tokens seed liquidity on Uniswap or Balancer. Your project controls this LP position.

### Activate Governance

If governance is part of your token design, activate it promptly. An early community vote — even on something modest — establishes that the token has real utility beyond trading.

### Pursue Exchange Listings

Projects with large holder bases often receive inbound interest from exchanges. Be prepared with the technical and compliance prerequisites.

### Communicate Transparently

Provide regular, honest updates on development progress and treasury management. The projects that maintain credibility long-term are transparent about both successes and setbacks.
