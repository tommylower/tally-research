# Tally

Tally is infrastructure for token launches, governance, and staking. We power token launch success so teams can focus on growth.

## What Tally Does

### Token Sales

Full-stack token launch infrastructure for projects raising capital through ICOs and token sales.

**Sale Mechanisms:**
- Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA): On-chain auctions where bids are spread across auction blocks, each clearing at the market price. Eliminates timing games and front-running.
- Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP): Price discovery through a declining price curve on Balancer, discouraging early speculation.
- Fixed-Price Sales: Predetermined pricing with optional allocation limits and eligibility scoring.

**Platform Capabilities:**
- KYC/KYB/KYI identity verification
- Geo-blocking and region-specific lockups
- Branded, white-labeled sale pages on your domain
- Post-sale DEX liquidity seeding (Uniswap, Balancer)
- On-chain vesting and lockups
- Real-time dashboards for participation and price discovery
- Multichain support: Ethereum, Arbitrum, ZKsync, Base, Monad, and more

### Governance

On-chain governance infrastructure for protocol upgrades and treasury management.

- On-chain proposal creation and voting
- Autonomous proposal execution
- Transparent voting power management
- Signal voting
- Custodian integration (BitGo, Fireblocks, Anchorage)
- Security council elections
- Extensible via Tally API

### Staking

Design and deploy incentive programs to bootstrap protocol usage and accrue token value.

- Industry-standard staking contracts
- Reward parameters for on-chain actions
- Governance-compatible staking (no sacrifice of voting rights)
- Multiple reward sources: protocol revenue, treasury, emissions
- Delegate compensation systems
